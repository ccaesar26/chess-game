## Overview

Chess Game is a Windows application developed in C++ using the Qt framework for the graphical user interface. The project involves the implementation of chess game logic and a user-friendly interface to enhance the gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Chess Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [Chess Game GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ccaesar26/chess-game).
2. Ensure that you have Qt installed on your system.
3. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred IDE.
4. Build and run the application on your Windows machine.

## Features

- **Chess Logic**: The application implements standard chess game logic, allowing players to make moves according to the rules of chess.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The Qt-based user interface provides an intuitive and visually appealing way to play chess.
- **Documentation**: The API for the chess logic is documented using Doxygen for easy reference and understanding.

## Requirements

- Qt framework (version used in development: [version])
- C++ compiler with support for C++17 standard
- Google Test framework for unit testing (optional)

## Implementation Details

- **Modern C++ Standard**: The project is coded using the modern C++ standard, likely version 17, to adhere to best practices and language advancements.
- **Design Patterns**: The Observer design pattern is employed to handle interactions between game components.
- **Unit Testing**: The chess logic is thoroughly tested using Google Test framework to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Development Team

The project was developed by a team of two during an internship:

- [ccaesar26](https://github.com/ccaesar26)
- [Gabi-Plosnita](https://github.com/Gabi-Plosnita)

## Additional Components

- **Console UI**: In addition to the graphical user interface, a simple console-based UI is also available for playing the game.

## Development Timeline

The project was developed over a period of 5 weeks during an internship. It served as an opportunity to learn about modern C++ standards, design patterns, and Qt framework for GUI development.
